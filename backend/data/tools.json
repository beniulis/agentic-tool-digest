It’s optimized for AWS development, recommending idiomatic usage of services like Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB, and can generate boilerplate that connects those services. The tool also includes security scanning to detect hardcoded secrets and common vulnerabilities, plus code references that attribute suggestions similar to open-source samples. It targets professional developers building cloud applications who want speed with guardrails and deep AWS integration.",

      "Free for individuals is a plus, but orgs weigh Professional pricing vs existing Copilot seats; perceived vendor lock-in to AWS patterns is a common critique"

      "Pricing is a sticking point: it’s a paid add‑on on top of JetBrains licenses, leading to value comparisons with Copilot/Codeium and debates over whether completions alone justify another subscription.",
      "Privacy and data handling get attention: developers like that JetBrains runs its own model and says it won’t train on private code, but some still want on‑prem or stricter data residency options.",
      "Latency and reliability are generally good but not perfect—fast after indexing, with occasional lag or rate limits during long sessions or on very large projects.",
      "Strengths are clearest on JVM stacks; coverage feels less consistent in Python/JS, and since it’s tied to JetBrains IDEs, multi-editor users feel locked in compared to cross-editor alternatives."
