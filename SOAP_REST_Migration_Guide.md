## What are Services?

A **service** in computing is like a restaurant - you (the client) don't cook the food yourself, instead you ask the restaurant to make it for you. Similarly, a service is a program that sits on a computer and waits for other programs to ask it to do work.

### Key Concepts:
- **Service**: A program that provides functionality to other programs
- **Client**: The program that requests services
- **Endpoint**: A specific URL where you can access the service (like a specific window at a drive-through)

## How Programs Communicate Over Networks

### The Network is Like a Mail System
When programs communicate over networks:

1. **Address**: Every computer has an IP address (like 192.168.1.100)
2. **Port**: Each service listens on a specific "mailbox number" (like 8733 or 5090)
3. **Message**: Your program sends a request message
4. **Response**: The service sends back a response message

### HTTP Protocol
Both SOAP and REST use HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) - a standardized way to format requests.

**Example HTTP Request:**
```
GET /api/migrations HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5090
```

**Example HTTP Response:**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[{"Id":1,"Name":"Initial Schema","Date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00"}]
```

## SOAP vs REST: Core Differences

### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
**Like**: A formal government office with strict procedures

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **More structured** - very precise rules about format
- ✅ **More features** - can handle complex scenarios, security, transactions
- ✅ **Built-in security** - sophisticated authentication and authorization
- ✅ **Formal contracts** - WSDL files describe exact service specifications
- ❌ **Verbose** - lots of "wrapper" text that's just overhead
- ❌ **Complex** - harder for humans to read and debug

**SOAP Request Example:**
```xml
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">
  <soap:Body>
    <GetMigrations xmlns="http://tempuri.org/" />
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

### REST (REpresentational State Transfer)
**Like**: A simple, direct phone call

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **Efficient** - minimal overhead, just the data you need
- ✅ **Human-readable** - easy to understand and debug
- ✅ **Simple** - straightforward HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- ✅ **Widely adopted** - industry standard for modern APIs
- ❌ **Less structured** - fewer built-in rules and features
- ❌ **Manual security** - you have to implement security yourself

**REST Request Example:**
```
GET /api/migrations HTTP/1.1
```

### When to Use Which

**Use SOAP for:**
- Banking systems (security, transactions)
- Medical records (privacy, compliance)
- Government systems (formal contracts)
- Enterprise systems requiring guaranteed reliability

**Use REST for:**
- Mobile apps (simplicity, speed)
- Web applications (ease of development)
- Public APIs (accessibility)
- Modern microservices (performance)

## Real-World Example: Migration Service

Our lab service tracks database schema changes over time, like a change log for database structure.

### Data Model: Migration Class
```csharp
[DataContract]
public class Migration
{
    [DataMember]
    public int Id { get; set; }           // Sequence number (1, 2, 3...)
    
    [DataMember] 
    public required string Name { get; set; }  // What changed ("Add Users Table")
    
    [DataMember]
    public DateTime Date { get; set; }    // When it happened
}
```

### Sample Data
```json
[
  {"Id":1, "Name":"Initial Schema", "Date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00"},
  {"Id":2, "Name":"Add Users Table", "Date":"2024-02-01T00:00:00"}, 
  {"Id":3, "Name":"Add Indexes", "Date":"2024-03-01T00:00:00"}
]
```

**What Each Migration Represents:**
- **Initial Schema**: Basic database structure (tables, columns)
- **Add Users Table**: New functionality (user management)
- **Add Indexes**: Performance optimization (faster searches)

## Running the Lab SOAP Service

### Project Structure
```
lab-soap-service/
├── Program.cs                 # Entry point and service configuration
├── MigrationService.csproj    # Project configuration and dependencies
├── Models/
│   └── Migration.cs           # Data model
├── Services/
│   └── MigrationService.cs    # Business logic (SOAP contract & implementation)
└── test-request.xml           # Sample SOAP request
```

### Key Files Explained

#### MigrationService.csproj
```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="CoreWCF.Http" Version="1.8.0" />           <!-- SOAP support -->
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi" Version="9.0.0" />  <!-- REST support -->
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

#### Services/MigrationService.cs
```csharp
[ServiceContract]                    // Tells SOAP this is a service contract
public interface IMigrationService
{
    [OperationContract]             // Tells SOAP this method is exposed
    List<Migration> GetMigrations();
}

public class MigrationService : IMigrationService
{
    public List<Migration> GetMigrations()
    {
        // Returns hardcoded sample data
        // In production, this would query a database
        return new List<Migration>
        {
            new() { Id = 1, Name = "Initial Schema", Date = new DateTime(2024, 1, 1) },
            new() { Id = 2, Name = "Add Users Table", Date = new DateTime(2024, 2, 1) },
            new() { Id = 3, Name = "Add Indexes", Date = new DateTime(2024, 3, 1) }
        };
    }
}
```

### How to Run the Service

1. **Start the service:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\bene_\desktop\lab-soap-service
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Service starts on port 8733 and provides:**
   - **REST endpoint**: `http://localhost:8733/api/migrations`
   - **SOAP endpoint**: `http://localhost:8733/MigrationService.svc`
   - **Documentation**: `http://localhost:8733/` (Swagger UI)
   - **SOAP contract**: `http://localhost:8733/MigrationService.svc?wsdl`

### What `dotnet run` Does

1. **Finds project file** (`MigrationService.csproj`)
2. **Reads configuration** (target framework, dependencies)
3. **Downloads missing libraries** (if needed)
4. **Compiles C# code** to machine code
5. **Runs Program.cs** (entry point)
6. **Program.cs executes** and starts web server
7. **Service listens** for requests on specified port

### Testing the Endpoints

**REST Endpoint (Simple):**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8733/api/migrations"
```
Response:
```json
[{"id":1,"name":"Initial Schema","date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00"}, ...]
```

**SOAP Endpoint (Complex):**
Requires XML request with SOAP envelope - see `test-request.xml`

## Migration Agent Analysis

### The Challenge
Our migration agent attempts to automatically convert SOAP services to REST services. This is complex because it must preserve:
- **Functionality** (same operations)
- **Data structures** (same information)
- **Security model** (same access controls)
- **Error handling** (same failure scenarios)
- **Performance characteristics** (similar response times)

### Experiment Results
When we tested the migration agent:

**✅ Successful aspects:**
- Code generation (created new project)
- Build process (compiled successfully)
- Data model preservation (copied Migration class)

**❌ Failed aspects:**
- Port configuration (used 5131 instead of configured 5090)
- Endpoint creation (generated weather forecast instead of migration endpoints)
- Business logic translation (didn't mirror SOAP operations)

### Root Cause
The failure was in the **GPT model's code generation**, not the infrastructure. The model:
- Ignored specific port instructions
- Generated default template instead of migration-specific code
- Didn't properly translate SOAP operations to REST endpoints

### Verification Test
When we manually corrected the generated code:
- Fixed port configuration (5090)
- Added proper `/api/migrations` endpoint
- Fixed namespace issues

**Result**: ✅ **100% parity test success** (5/5 SOAP-to-REST comparisons passed)

This confirmed that the agent infrastructure works correctly - the issue was purely in the LLM's instruction following for code generation.

## Key Takeaways

1. **SOAP vs REST**: REST is simpler for most use cases, SOAP provides more features for complex enterprise scenarios

2. **Migration complexity**: Converting between protocols requires preserving functionality, security, and performance - not just translating syntax

3. **Industry trends**: 90%+ of new projects use REST due to simplicity and performance

4. **Migration tools**: Automated migration is challenging but valuable for large enterprise systems with hundreds of services

5. **Testing approach**: Having both SOAP and REST versions of the same service enables verification that migrations produce identical results

## Libraries Used

**SOAP Libraries:**
- `CoreWCF.Http` - SOAP/WCF functionality for .NET
- `CoreWCF.Primitives` - Core WCF primitives

**REST Libraries:**
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` - REST API functionality
- `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore` - API documentation generation
